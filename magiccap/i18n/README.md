# MagicCap Internationalisation
This folder contains all of the internationalisation parts of MagicCap.

## How do I add a language?
To create a language pack, simply run `add_lang.py` (if it instantly crashes or gives the error `Requested Python version (2.7) is not installed`, try launching with `python ./add_lang.py` from the terminal) and follow the steps. Please note that the ISO 639-1 language code/language name must be unique. After you run this, a folder will be created by the name of the ISO 639-1 language code. Inside will be *.po files which can be managed by CrowdIn.

The language will then need to be added to CrowdIn.
